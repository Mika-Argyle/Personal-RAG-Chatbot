# RAG Chatbot Personal Website Project Summary

## Project Overview
Building a personal website with RAG-powered chatbot to showcase ML/AI skills for job applications. Should be a great way to demonstrate end-to-end AI system development.

## Recommended Tech Stack
- **Vector Store**: Pinecone (managed, reliable, good free tier)
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (cost-effective, widely used)
- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (cheap, fast, good enough)
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Python (perfect for ML/AI work)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with nice APIs)
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment**: Vercel for frontend

## Development Environment Setup
**Recommended**: Native Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or Pop!_OS)
- Better performance and ecosystem for ML/AI development
- Dual boot with Windows for safety
- Need 8GB+ USB drive for installation

## FastAPI Implementation Steps (Bite-sized for motivation)
1. **Day 1**: Hello World endpoint (30 min)
2. **Day 2**: Add document POST endpoint (45 min)
3. **Day 3**: Store documents in memory (30 min)
4. **Day 4**: Add GET endpoint to retrieve documents (30 min)

## Overall Project Timeline
2-3 weeks part-time, building incrementally:
1. Basic FastAPI backend
2. OpenAI integration for chat
3. Pinecone vector storage/retrieval
4. React frontend
5. Connect everything and deploy

## Key Learning Outcomes
- RAG implementation and vector databases
- Full-stack development with AI integration
- API design and deployment
- Concrete project for job interviews

## Next Steps
1. Get USB drive and set up Linux
2. Start with FastAPI hello world
3. Build incrementally, celebrating small wins
4. Document progress for portfolio/blog post
